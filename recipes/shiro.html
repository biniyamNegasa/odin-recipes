    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Shiro, also called shiro wat, is a stew served for either lunch or dinner, originating from Ethiopia and Eritrea. An essential part of Eritrean and Ethiopian cuisine, its primary ingredient is powdered chickpeas and often prepared with the addition of minced onions, garlic and, depending upon regional variation, ground ginger or chopped tomatoes and chili-peppers. Shiro is served atop injera (leavened flatbread).</p>
