    <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Ethiopian potato stew (AKA dinich wot) is one of my favourite plant-based stews for fall. It’s incredibly hearty, spicy and super easy to make. Traditionally this recipe is served on top of a large platter of injera with other colourful vegan stews. However, it can be enjoyed with rice, fonio or in my case on its own with fresh bread on the side. I also love to substitute in ingredients like sweet potato, pumpkin and okra to switch up the flavours. Feel free to add your own twist on it and warm up this fall with a bowl of Ethiopian comfort food.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large yellow onions, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3-4 Tbsp berbere spice</li>
      <li>5 cloves minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp minced ginger</li>
      <li>¼ cup crushed tomato</li>
      <li>3 large potatoes, peeled and chopped into thick chunks</li>
      <li>1 ½ cup hot water (adjust as needed)</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>To a large heated pot, add oil and onions. Once the onions begin to caramelize, add berbere spice, stir well so the onions are coated.</li>
      <li>Add garlic and ginger and add a bit of water as necessary to the pot.</li>
      <li>Add crushed tomato and mix well. Add some water as necessary to prevent the mixture from burning.</li>
      <li>Once the ingredients are well incorporated, add the diced potatoes and hot water slowly and bring to simmer. Be careful not to add too much water.</li>
      <li>Cover with lid and stir occasionally adding more water as necessary.</li>
      <li>Once the potatoes are tender and the stew is finished, serve with injera, rice or on its own.</li>
    </ol>
